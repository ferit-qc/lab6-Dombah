        "Classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNNs) are a subclass of artificial neural networks which have the ability to determine particular features and patterns of a given input. Because of this, they are commonly used in image recognition and audio processing.\n",

        "An example of a CCNN can be seen in Figure 1, where a CCNN is trained to determine whether an input image either contains a cat or a dog. To do so, the input image passes through a series of alternating convolutional (C) and pooling layers (P), all of which detect patterns and associate each pattern to a cat or a dog. The fully connected layer (FC) provides us with an output which allows us to determine whether the input image was a cat or dog.\n",
        "\n",
        "The convolutional layer makes  use of a kernel, which can determine features and patterns of a particular input. An example of this is feature detection in an image, where different layers detect particular patterns in the input image. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, where the $l^{th}$ layer recognizes features and patterns along the $ij$ plane. It can then associate such features with a given output in the training process, and can use this process to train the dataset.\n",

Instead, we reduce the number of qubits by performing operations upon each until a specific point and then disregard certain qubits in a specific layer.
